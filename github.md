## Tips

1. To reference a commit in a issues comment, simply write its SHA-hash, and it'll automatically get turned into a link
2. Want to save an empty directory? use the ```.gitkeep``` file trick!
3. link/anchor to chapther/heading [example](##-Tips)
4. ```git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=99999999'```

## "We found a potential security vulnerability in one of your dependencies" message

Solution: just click on the Github's alert for information, usually you just need to update dependencies.

## "Something went really wrong and we can’t process that picture."

## Hide forever a file

Example: remove ```README.md``` from history and everywhere:

```
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch README.md' \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

and

```
git push --all --force
```
