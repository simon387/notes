## SVN login not working?

But in browser it works?

Turn this option to on:

```Settings -> Subversion -> Enable interactive mode```

Also I usually use a svn binary different from the one integrated in IntelliJ IDEA (if any)

For example i put it in this directory:

```C:\dev\svn\bin\svn.exe```

## Java debug not working?

Solved: there was an error on a plugin! I had to disabled it
